subtitle: A Master's student in Cryptography
---

My name is Luca Di Domenico. I am studying to become a cryptographer. Soon, I will be studying and resarching mathemathical papers, and I will probably be implementing some cryptographic primitives. Basically, I will be working hard to ensure that data and resources sent over the internet can travel securely between the users A and B, without being read or tampered by a malicious entity E.

In the meantime, you may as well enjoy this website!
